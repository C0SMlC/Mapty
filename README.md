[Live Here](https://c0smlc.github.io/Mapty/)
This wonderful website is a part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://codingheroes.io/) [The Complete JavaScript Course](The Complete JavaScript Course)
The original version of this website looks like [this](https://iampsr8.github.io/Mapty-App/), offcourse i have not made any changes in the design of the website as the main motive of this project was to learn JS, The concepts applied in this site are ->
1. Classes
2. Inheritance in classes
3. Private and protected fields in classes
## The changes i did are as follows-
1. Buttons to filter the activity
2. Close the activity tab 
3. Delete activity
4. Error Popups
